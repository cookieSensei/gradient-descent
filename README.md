Gradient descent algorithm: I was following a course on UDEMY (Complete 2022 Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp) by philipp muellauer, then it hit me that I could create a gradient descent app on R shiny based on the logic, the instructor taught. That's my inspiration for this gradient descent shiny app. Again, the code is my own, but I learned the logic from the above mentioned udemy course.
Here's the link to that udemy course "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning-bootcamp/"
